Run `make simple` inside this dir to build a lightweight version with custom-tailored dz/du function
Run `make` inside this dir to build a normal version (2011-08-27: DOES NOT COMPILE)

Binaries built with `make` will be placed in bin/

Other dirs:
src/ -- where the actual code is placed
obj/ -- containing the intermediate object files
bin/ -- binaries as said earlier
img/ -- container to place generated graphs into
doc/ -- Haddock generated documentation will be placed into this folder

TODO:
`make doc` runs Haddock and places well-formed documentation into doc/
`make clean` cleans obj/
`make purge` cleans obj/ , doc/ and bin/
Make cabalized version of AFCALC
Images generated by AFCALC should go to img/
